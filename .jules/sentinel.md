## 2026-04-15 - Fixed XSS vulnerability in ticketGenerator.ts
**Vulnerability:** User-controlled data (via escapeHTML with some bypass edge cases depending on HTML structure and attributes) was directly interpolated into an HTML string and assigned to `container.innerHTML` without a robust sanitization library.
**Learning:** Even if data is escaped before being inserted into an HTML string using basic regex replacements, it might still be vulnerable to XSS due to contextual edge cases or omissions in the custom escape function. The `sanitizeString` function is insufficient.
**Prevention:** Always use a mature, battle-tested sanitization library like `DOMPurify` (using `DOMPurify.sanitize()`) when dynamically injecting HTML content, rather than relying on custom string escaping logic.
